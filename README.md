# Convolutional-Neural-Network
Convolutional Neural Network or CNN is a type of deep learning neural networks which is used to analyze visual imagery. It has multiple benefits over basic MLP.
* Performs well when used to analyze complex images in analyzing the shape, texture and color.
* Uses 2D matrix as input (actual image) when compared to MLP which flattens it to a vector.
* Stores spatial information of pixels (position of pixels relative to each other)

CNN can be used for the following operations on an image:
* Edge detection (horizontal and vertical)
* Sharpen 
* Blurring 
* Brightening
* Darkening
